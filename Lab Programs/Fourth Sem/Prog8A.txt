//Kruskal's Algorithm


Start with an empty set A, and select at every stage the shortest edge that has not been chosen or
rejected, regardless of where this edge is situated in graph.
 Initially, each vertex is in its own tree in forest.
 Then, algorithm consider each edge in turn, order by increasing weight.
 If an edge (u, v) connects two different trees, then (u, v) is added to the set of edges of the
MST, and two trees connected by an edge (u, v) are merged into a single tree.
 On the other hand, if an edge (u, v) connects two vertices in the same tree, then edge (u, v)
is discarded.
