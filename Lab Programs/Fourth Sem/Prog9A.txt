//Prim's Algorithm

Choose a node and build a tree from there selecting at every stage the shortest available edge that
can extend the tree to an additional node.
 Prim's algorithm has the property that the edges in the set A always form a single tree.
 We begin with some vertex v in a given graph G =(V, E), defining the initial set of vertices
A.
 In each iteration, we choose a minimum-weight edge (u, v), connecting a vertex v in the set
A to the vertex u outside of set A.
 The vertex u is brought in to A. This process is repeated until a spanning tree is formed.
 Like Kruskal's algorithm, here too, the important fact about MSTs is we always choose the
smallest-weight edge joining a vertex inside set A to the one outside the set A.
 The implication of this fact is that it adds only edges that are safe for A; therefore when the
algorithm terminates, the edges in set A form a MST
