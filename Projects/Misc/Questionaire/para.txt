To begin with, Jallikattu is, without a doubt, a direct form of animal abuse. If an animal is made to feel intimidated and potentially hurt (not necessarily killed), it is clearly interpreted as animal abuse. The basis of the game is controlling the “angry bull” and in order to do so, the bull is agitated and made to run around in anger/fear which clearly can not be achieved by any gentle methods. Some say the bull is made to drink wine, sprayed pepper/chilly in the eyes to be agitated. However, I’m not going to accept or deny those arguments but I wouldn’t want them to be the basis for my support of the ban as they could be isolated incidents or mere allegations. Besides, the people hanging on the back of the bull pose a risk to their own lives as well as risk the bull’s injury in the process. There have been incidents of loss of both human life and animal life during the sport.( Source : NDTV news ndtv.com/south/one-dead-67-injured-in-tamil-nadu-during-jallikattu-events-510549). The supporters of Jallikattu also advanced the argument that, not only Jallikattu, but humans are hurt and killed in other sports as well, which includes cricket. The obvious point that they are missing here is that humans play the game with their own consent, they aren’t agitated/abused in order to perform where the animals in Jallikattu don’t give their consent to be abused. One could say that the animals working in transportation and fields also do not give the consent, then why selective opposition? Animals in the transportation are not abused, they are made to work and in return, they are fed and taken care of by the caretakers. There is a fine line between a sport and abuse, for example, bull race could be a sport but not Jallikattu for reasons mentioned above.
