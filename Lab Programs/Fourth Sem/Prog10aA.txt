//Floyd's Algorithm
• Accept no .of vertices
• Call graph function to read weighted graph // w(i,j)
• Set D[ ] <- weighted graph matrix // get D {d(i,j)} for k=0
• // If there is a cycle in graph, abort. How to find?
• Repeat for k = 1 to n 
  Repeat for i = 1 to n
  Repeat for j = 1 to n
   D[i,j] = min {D[i,j], D[i,k] + D[k,j]}
• Print D
