Coupling

It's a measure of how interconnected classes are.
Tightly coupled.
Loosely coupled better.

Changes must be isolated

Inheritance
Is A relationship

Composition
Has A relationship

Favour Composition over Inheritance

*Inheritance*
Pros: Code re-use, easier to understand
Cons: Tightly coupled

Animal
Age: int
Eat()
Sleep()

Person and Dog derive from animal

We can add functionality called Walk()

Add Goldfish to derive from Animal

FAIL

Must have minimal impact

Person and Dog has an Animal class
Walkable class

Add Goldfish
Swimmable

Duck class

Composition
Pros: Flexible, Code re-use, Loose coupling

With composition we can replace a class with an interface
